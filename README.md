# CPSC230: Intro to Computing

Students are introduced to problem–solving methods and algorithm development through an interactive and easy–to–learn programming language, Python.

## Textbook

 Langtangen, H.P., _A Primer on Scientific Programming in Python_, Springer Verlag 2014, ISBN 978-3-642-54959-5. See [http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642549588]() to buy hardcopy or ebook.

## Communication

### Email

Email is older than your parents. Modern communication tools like Slack are used in professional settings to facilitate better, more focused communication.

I generally answer emails only once a day during the week and may not answer at all on the weekend. You ar welcome to use email for non-course communication, but I encourage you to use Slack instead.


### Slack

Use the Slack channel ```#csc230-04-sp16``` on the Schmid College Slack student team ```scst_students```.
I am notified of activity here throughout the day. So this is the faster way to get feedback from me and classmates. Note that all messages are public. If you want to communicate privately with me, use the direct message channel ```@dr.m```.

### Piazza

[http://piazza.com] hosts our class content disussion board. You have received an invitation. I will use this for polling and quick assessment of my work (am I helping you learn). Think of it as my Continuous Quality Control.

## Methods of Evaluation

Grades will be based on an in-class midterm exam (20%), in-class final exam (25%), regularly assigned homeworks (20%), participation in piazza discussion (10%) and a final project (25%).

### Homework Assignments

The purpose of the assignments is twofold:
1. An assignment should help you learn to think like a programmer.
This includes making honest attempts to understand a problem, even if you have not solved it to your satisfaction.
The assignments are intended to help you develop the habits of work and habits of mind that characterize a good programmer.
2. An assignment should help inform me regarding your progress,  so we can respond usefully to weaknesses (perhaps on my part as well).

Homeworks will be graded very ciritically. Merely turning something in is a waste of our time. Any work you submit must meet the following to receive any points.

* It must not contain any syntactic errors in the code.
* You must have 'signed' the included honor pledge.
* Your README.md file must include a description of the work and a brief discussion of what you learned from doing the work.

If any of these criteria are not met, your work will not be graded.

### Piazza

Regular participation in [http://piazza.com]() may influence your final grade by about one letter grade.
To earn all 10%, you must participate in all polls that I post and you must contribute regularly to the homework discussions on line. I do not have a fixed criterion for regular contribution as this is the first time I have used this medium extensively.
I intend to assign credit for this generously. If you make an effort to participate, you will get full credit.

### Reading

To get the most from lecture time, it is essential that you read the assigned sections before coming to class.
Technical reading is unlike casual reading (short stories, news, and so on).
Even though a reading assignment may involve only a few pages, you should expect to take about 45 minutes prior each class for reading.

### Project

In about the 10th week, I will describe a substantial project for you to complete. Details will be supplied later.


## Your Time Allocation

A three credit course typically requires approximately 145 hours of your time to earn a passing grade. The follow are estimates, but I expect that you will be able to succeed with a passing grade (C or better) by budgeting your time as follows:

| Task | Estimation |  Hours |
|--|--|--:|
|Lecture attendance | 29[lec]* 1.5[hr/lec]|43.5 |
|	Reading | 15[wk]* 1.5[hr/wk] |  22.5 |
|	Working exercises | 13[wk]* 3.0[hr/wk] |  39.0 |
|	Piazza contribution |  15[wk] *  0.5[hr/wk] | 7.5 |
|	Mid-term prep | 2.0[hr] |2.0 |
|	Midterm | 1.5[hr]  | 1.5 |
|	Project |24.0[hr] | 24.0 |
|   Final Prep | 3.0[hr] | 3.0 |
|   Final  | 2.5[hr] | 2.5 |
